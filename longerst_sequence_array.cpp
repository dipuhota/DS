/*Given an array of positive integers. Find the length of the longest subsequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the
consecutive numbers can be in any order.
Input:
N = 7
a[] = {2,6,1,9,4,5,3}
Output:
6
Explanation:
5
5
The consecutive numbers here
are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These 6
numbers form the longest consecutive
subsquence.
